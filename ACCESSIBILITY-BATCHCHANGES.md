[Accessibility Audit] Batch Changes: Set up src-cli to use with Batch Changes

NOTE: Some aspects of this journey require interacting with applications outside of our typical control. For example, a user might use a particular terminal that has accessibility issues that we cannot be aware of and cannot restrict like we do with browsers. Please aim to audit these steps with this in mind. At the very least we should ensure that the instructions for what the user should do (e.g. installing src-cli) are accessible.

- Install [src-cli](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/batch_changes/quickstart#install-the-sourcegraph-cli)
- From the web GUI, click your user profile avatar in the top right corner
- Click “Settings” from the dropdown menu
- Click “Access tokens” from the sidebar, within the “Account” section
- Click “Generate a new token”
- Enter a name for the token, e.g. “src-cli”
- Click “+ Generate token”
- Click the button to copy the access token
- Provide the access token as an environment variable from your shell environment (multiple ways to do this)
- Run [src login](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/cli/references/login)
