# Deployment

Sourcegraph supports a variety of deployment methods including Docker (single container), Docker Compose, and Kubernetes. Each of these methods will require a different level of investment and should be based on the needs and desired outcomes for your business. 

If you aren't currently working wth our Customer Engineering team, we recommend taking a look at our [Deployment Overview](deployment_overview.md) section. It will provide a high-level view of what's available and needed depending on the method you choose.

If you already know which method you want to use, use the table of contents below to navigate the relevant topics.
