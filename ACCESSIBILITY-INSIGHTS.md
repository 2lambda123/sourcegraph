[Accessibility Audit] Insights: Delete dashboard

### Steps to replicate journey

Taken from the [user journey list document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m8oYTFgim8epA2IfPFCTN2QFSDxODV5WJNe2JhRdMZA/edit?usp=sharing). Use this for further context.

- Open the dashboard page and select the dashboard you want to delete
- Click three dot menu next to the dashboard select
- Click the “delete” context item
- Note: that all insights on this removed dashboard won’t be removed, You still have access to them through the “All insights” dashboard and you can add them to other dashboards later

### How to audit

Follow the instructions here: [Auditing a user journey](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/background-information/web/accessibility/how-to-audit#auditing-a-user-journey)

**Note:** We are planning on arranging thorough third-party audit in the future, so our focus here is just to find the _majority_ of accessibility issues. Don't worry if you feel you haven't found 100% of potential issues, it is better to focus on the core essentials to complete the journey rather than spending lots of time going through every possible problem.

### How to raise discovered problems
