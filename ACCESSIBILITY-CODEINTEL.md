**Note:** We are planning on arranging thorough third-party audit in the future, so our focus here is just to find the _majority_ of accessibility issues. Don't worry if you feel you haven't found 100% of potential issues, it is better to focus on the core essentials to complete the journey rather than spending lots of time going through every possible problem.
